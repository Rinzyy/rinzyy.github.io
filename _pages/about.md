# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Rindy Tuy  
[ðŸ“„ View My Resume](https://rinzyy.github.io/files/Rindy_Tuy-Resume-pdf.pdf)



## ðŸš€ Who I Am

Iâ€™m a Computer Science student and technician based in Houston, Texas, with a strong foundation in system support, hardware/software troubleshooting, and a deep curiosity about the future of intelligence. I thrive on solving technical problems, learning emerging technologies, and contributing to meaningful projects that intersect with systems, AI, and automation.



## ðŸ›  Technical Skills & Experience

- Hardware & Software Support: installation, configuration, testing, repair, troubleshooting  
- Networks & Systems: understanding of networking protocols, cabling, system monitoring, backup strategies  
- Tools & Environments: Windows, macOS, standard office tools, inventory management, peripherals (printers, scanners, etc.)  
- Leadership & Collaboration: leading teams, coordinating tasks, communicating technical issues clearly  
- Process & Documentation: performance tracking, logging, reporting, quality control  



## ðŸ§  My Goals & Vision

Hereâ€™s how I see myself engaging with the field, and where I want to grow:

- Deepen my skills in AI/ML (especially LLMs, multimodal models) â€” building projects, exploring how they learn, generalize, and fail  
- Experiment with small systems or agents that combine domain-knowledge with learning components (hybrid systems)  
- Keep up with AGI â€” what metrics people use, what breakthroughs are coming, what limitations remain  



## ðŸŒ± Outside of Code

When Iâ€™m not working with machines or reading AI papers, I enjoy fitness, reading about philosophy & future tech, self-improvement, and playing/watching soccer. All of these help me maintain balance, draw inspiration, and stay inquisitive.
